# Assignment 5
**Group 23**
#### _learning experience_
##### _Starting point amnd destination_
Due to Group 23’s limited experience with BIM, the starting level is identified to be R1: Open BIM Modeller, in particular, Level 1: Modelling a building in native (closed) BIM software and exporting to IFC, with a focus on mapping modelled properties. The main assignment (A3) is best described by R2: Open BIM Analyst, Level 3: Develop standalone Python programmes using ifcOpenShell for specific use cases, suggesting that this would be the final development stage. However, Group 23 feels to have achieved even more, compared to when started with a very limited understanding of the subject. Countless hours without tutoring have been spent to figure out which methods/codes work best for the group’s use case; thus, the members consider themselves Self-Learners. Lastly, they also relate to the OpenBIM Manager Levels 2 (due to the BPMN diagrams application to systematise the project flow) and 3 (due to the significantly automated process of creation of a Gantt chart). 

##### _More to learn_
During the A3 submission, it was noticed an unrealistic aspect - starting the SkyLab construction of all floors at the same time. To fix this problem, a much longer and more complicated script should be prepared, thus, the members focused their resources on more detailed activities (sub-tasks), leaving the ’error’ for further development if this course was continuing.  
Overall, there is much more to be learnt from OpenBIM and applied for project managers to ease their responsibilities and save up time and other resources.  

##### _Future use_
Group 23’s members were extremely happy with the A3 results when a Gantt chart was generated fairly easily via a Python script (requiring the action) and an IFC model (providing data). Therefore, as students interested in Project Management, they are highly motivated to use this feature of the OpenBIM space in their future jobs and endeavours. Nevertheless, the concept of accessible information and collaboration is viewed by them as support in progress, especially now when they are trying to add as much as possible to their Toolbox for the unknown future. 

#### _Developing the tutorial_
For the thesis, Group 23 is hesitant currently about whether to write about BIM or directly related to this course. What has been learned in scheduling, and BlenderBIM would be for sure needed for work, in particular extracting quantities and drafting time schedules.  

##### _less choice in the use cases_
No, this option would not have been preferred. The open choice for the use case has been meaningful. Having the members define their case to work with in areas they find suitable and interesting for their current student jobs and future careers. 

##### _Number of tools in the course_
It was an appropriate amount. One of the members particularly liked the fact that Excel was used for IFC data. Even if the work seemed more manual, it aided the understanding of the following tools. 

#### _Feedback on the tutorial_
- This section would be fully quoted from Group 10. 
1. Did the tool address the use case you identified? 
‘Yes, it did. It was great, and it successfully managed to create a construction plan. Of course, this is only the beginning of a longer script that can make a very complicated plan. It was super easy to run the script and it produced a result that could easily be implemented.’ 
2. Was the use case well modelled?
‘Yes, very much so. It does what it's supposed to do. Right now, all tasks start at the same time even though that's not the intention or feasible in reality. This could be optimized. In addition, it might be worth considering how to make tasks overlap, as this would normally be the case on a construction site.’ 
3. Was the project clearly scoped?
‘Yes, and it was very successful in creating a script that makes a construction plan. The explanation of the script is also suitable for an R2 analyst at level three, as these are individuals who have appropriate experience with Python, BlenderBIM, and creating schedules for construction projects.’ 

#### _Future for Advanced use of OpenBIM_
The group members are at different stages in their education and doing different degrees at DTU, thus, it is hard to conclude that OpenBIM tools would be used in the theses. However, it is worth mentioning that they got inspired by two of the guest lectures during the study term – students who are currently working on their thesis and presented how design should be accessible and how is that possible via OpenBIM. 
In the next 10 years, the group members feel that they would face the usage of OpenBIM a lot in their professional life and would be able to apply some of the developed skills and tools during this term.
